# GitExtensions.BundleBackuper
GIT bundles is a great way to create backups of local branches. This extension for [GitExtensions](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions) creates item in top menu containg all bundles at specified path. Clicking bundle item maps this bundle as remote. Beside this restore operation, it also contains button to create bundle/backup between current branch head and last commit pushed commit.
